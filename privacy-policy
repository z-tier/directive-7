- Role and channel IDs for role management and permissions.
- We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information.

2. How We Use It

- To support moderation tools (e.g., mute, warn, kick).
- To automate specific Vector-7 game features or community roles.

3. Data Retention
- No data is permanently stored outside of Discord.
- Temporary data (e.g., mute timers, levels) may be stored in memory while the bot is running.
